            A Surveying Lab is a facility or department that is dedicated to the
            study, analysis, and measurement of the earth's surface and its
            features. Surveying is the science of determining the relative
            positions of points on or near the surface of the earth. The lab may
            offer training and education on surveying techniques, including
            topographic surveying, geodetic surveying, and construction
            surveying. It may also conduct research and development in the area
            of surveying technology, such as developing new surveying methods,
            improving accuracy and precision, and exploring the use of remote
            sensing and photogrammetry in surveying.
